           I'm currently a student (cs) and there's a lot of things I like so I wanted to put it all in one big website. Why?
           For my personal records and the world as a whole, here's my yap.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Currently I am working on : </u> <br>
            -> this website whaaat and GIT<br>
            -> surviving the uni <br>
            -> getting more steps in <br>
            -> finishing two books I am reading (no longer human and technofeudalism) <br>
            -> improv!! <br>
            -> getting some sort of income
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>My latest in progress blog entry :</u><br>
            modesty and modesty culture, how does it intersect with religion and colonialism? Is it true
            that people used to dress much more modestly back then and why is there a resurgence recently on
            policing women's bodies.
